\section{Outlook}\label{sec:outlook}

This prokect is meant to be continued and improved in another class. Future work will include finding starting values for training parameters, testing the whole pipeline with simulated picture followed by an analization of its performance, training of parameters and
adjustments of model and pipeline. The performance of the single tasks will reveal the quality of the choosen methods and models. Those might be adjusted or replaced. A description of the future yield development could also be included in the model, since it is an important part but only poorly modelled jet.
