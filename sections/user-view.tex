This section provides a basic overview of the project's domain.
Most presented aspects here will be used in later parts of this project either to design certain aspects of the model
or to conduct the simulation of the domain.

Finally, the expectations and requirements from the user-view are described which the subsequent parts of this
project are built upon.
