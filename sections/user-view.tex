\section{User-View}\label{sec:user-view}
\input{members/ssr/authors}

This section provides a basic overview of the project's domain and the view of the system from the user's perspective.
Most presented aspects here will be used in later parts of this project - either to design certain aspects of the model
or to conduct the simulation.
However, this project is only concerned with tomato plants.

Notice that certain aspects of the plant's life-cycle and greenhouse operations won't be introduced here,
since they are not relevant for the designed system, except of illumination.\\

Once the basic aspects of a greenhouse have been introduced then the expectations and requirements
from the user-view are described which the subsequent parts of this project are built upon.
