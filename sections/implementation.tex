\section{Implementation and Evaluation}\label{sec:implementation-and-evaluation}

Within the given time constraints of the project the entire design couldn't be implemented and evaluated - still an implementation
has been made to test the robustness of extracting the two main metrics for the yield estimation computation.
As described these are the \textit{top-view leaf area} and the tip of the plant.
\\
\\
An additional goal of the implementation was to gather color distributions from leaf areas for realistic material simulation.

Following is a description of the computational pipeline with the parameters and the finding on the usefulness of the design choices
on how to measure the needed metrics.
