\input{members/ssr/authors}

Within the given time constraints of the project the entire design couldn't be implemented, evaluated and refined.
Nonetheless, an implementation has been conducted to test the pipelines and evaluate the practicality of the modelling ideas
and to gather data, such as:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Segmenting leaf area from non-leaf area to estimate the leaf area visible from above - for the LAI computation
    \item Gathering color distributions of leaf areas, based on the segmentation.
    \item Locating the tip of the plant - for the height estimation
\end{enumerate}

A general description of the pipeline and high-level ideas have been describe in the model section, this
section however exactly explains how the mentioned aspects have been extracted which are the main metrics for
further computations.\\

Firstly, the general architecture and platform are briefly described and then each step of the computational
pipeline with example outputs are shown.
