\subsection{Pipeline and Algorithms}\label{subsec:pipeline}

This section provides a detailed look at the implementation level of the selected algorithms
with all its parameters.
Notice that some parts of the implementation deviate from the description the modelling section
this mostly applies to the section which locates vertical edges, since a slightly more practical
and simpler version has been implemented. Nonetheless, the original algorithm in the modelling
section should lead to better results, but hasn't been fully implemented yet.
However the presented algorithm leads to solid results.
